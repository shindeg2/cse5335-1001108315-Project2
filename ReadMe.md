    ### What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
A] Creating the database and adding records to it because it was staright-forward.

    ### What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
A] Retrieving the data by calling the server side framework. I was not able to get the record properly. Since I was working on nodejs for the first time, that made it a little complicated while retrieving.

    ### If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest
concern?
A] I think biggest concern would be handling big data.
